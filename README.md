DESCRIPTION:

The main objective of the program is to demonstrate a clocking system that emulates the working of a modern wrist watch with an analog display and features such as an alarming system and a stopwatch system using OpenGL graphics library. It is a real-time application that can be used to perform activities, which involve keeping a track of time.  The clocking system comes with both digital and analog displays. The application is provided with a mouse interface using which the user can navigate to one of the four possible screens. The various screens available to the user are stop-watch screen, alarm screen, clock display screen and the exit screen. User friendly interfaces are shown  upon selecting an option. The keys used to start, stop and restart the stop-watch are shown on the bottom left corner of the screen. For setting up an alarm, the user is required to enter the alarm time in "hh:mm:ss" format on the console. Upon reaching the alarm time, the application prompts the user by making a sound until the user turns off the alarm. The clock display screen shows the system time in both analog and digital formats.
